Account Invoice Alternative Reports
===================================

Allow to define alternative reports for Invoices by party.

Add a new field in Invoice to select the report to use.

The user can choose between default report and invoice's party alternative
reports.

If the party doesn't have any alternative report, the default report is used.

If the party has one (and only one) alternative report, it's used by default.

If th party has more than one alternative report, the invoice's field is empty
to force the user to choose one manually (the field is required to confirm the
invoice).
